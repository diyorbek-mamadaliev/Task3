# Code Improvement and Enhancements

## Overview
In this project, I've made several improvements to enhance the organization, readability, maintainability, and robustness of the code. This readme file outlines the key changes made.

## Code Organization and Readability
I've reorganized and modularized to improve its overall organization and readability. This separation of logical parts and locators into different files has resulted in cleaner and more understandable code.

## Separation of Element Locators
To enhance maintainability and reduce redundancy, element locators have been separated from the main code. This practice ensures that any updates to locators are centralized, preventing duplication and simplifying maintenance.

## TestNG Integration with Soft Assertions
TestNG has been incorporated into the code, along with soft assertions. This integration allows for the creation of more robust tests by providing comprehensive test failure reports.

## @FindBy Annotations
One notable improvement in this project is the use of the `@FindBy` annotations for the first time. These annotations simplify the process of interacting with web elements, improving code clarity and reducing the risk of errors.

## Conclusion
These code improvements and enhancements have resulted in a more organized, readable, maintainable, and robust codebase. They contribute to a more efficient testing process and a better overall user experience.
